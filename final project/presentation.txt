Hi everyone!

This is the introduction to my final project with CS50P!
Project name: Pomodoro Timer
Usage: For management of study time

You may have heard of the Pomodoro technique for studying. The most popular one is called the 25/5 technique, 
where you split your studying time into distinct sessions of 25 minutes, each followed by a 5-minute break. 
This method is meant to make studying more effective.

With this concept, I am interested in creating an application that can help myself (and anyone interested :D ) 
to manage my time with a digital clock.

The final project is just the starting point, as in the future I want to improve my program and pair it with a 
physical clock (which can also be controlled via the application)

I hope you have a good time!

now lets try out the application!!!

i hope this application helps anyone who is interested. please recommend me some additional features i can add.
thanks for watching!!!
