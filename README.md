# POMODORO TIMER
    Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/kG9Z3YO3Ow4
    
    I wish to create a simple pomodoro timer app that prompts the user for a stopwatch/timer mode and input the amount of time they wish to study by.
    This project is an endeavor I have wanted to do for a long time, ever since I started learning programming. Its aim is to assist me in studies (I know there are pomodoro timer applications out there, but having one for my own personal use feels amazing XD) and anyone interested. I hope this is a good starting point for my journey ahead in programming.
    You may have heard of the Pomodoro technique for studying. The most popular one is called the 25/5 technique, where you split your studying time into distinct sessions of 25 minutes, each followed by a 5-minute break. This method is meant to make studying more effective.
    With this concept, I am interested in creating an application that can help myself (and anyone interested :D ) to manage my time with a digital clock.
    The final project is just the starting point, as in the future I want to improve my program and pair it with a physical clock (which can also be controlled via the application). The inspiration comes from James Scholz, a popular Youtuber who does study streams (I really love his digital clock, which can be controlled both via an app (presumably?) and by pressing buttons on the physical clock)
    I will have future updates on this application, as i want to design a user-friendly interface as well as adding other feature to the clock (count the number of sessions completed per day, break timers, user-specific customizations like how the clock should be displayed i.e. its colors, font, size, appearances, etc.; built-in to-do lists...)
